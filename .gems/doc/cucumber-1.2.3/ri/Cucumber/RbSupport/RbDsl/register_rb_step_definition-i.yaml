  body: "If provided, the <tt>symbol</tt> is sent to the <tt>World</tt> object as defined by #World.

If the <tt>options</tt> hash contains an <tt>:on</tt> key, the value for this is assumed to be a proc. This proc will be executed in the context of the <tt>World</tt> object and then sent the <tt>symbol</tt>."
