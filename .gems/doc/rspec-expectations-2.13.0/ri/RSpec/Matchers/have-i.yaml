- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Passes if receiver is a collection with the submitted number of items OR if the receiver OWNS a collection with the submitted number of items.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If the receiver OWNS the collection, you must use the name of the collection. So if a `Team` instance has a collection named `#players`, you must use that name to set the expectation.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If the receiver IS the collection, you can use any name you like for `named_collection`. We'd recommend using either &quot;elements&quot;, &quot;members&quot;, or &quot;items&quot; as these are all standard ways of describing the things IN a collection.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This also works for Strings, letting you set expectations about their lengths.
