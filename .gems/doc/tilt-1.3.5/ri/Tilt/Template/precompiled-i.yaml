  body: "Generates all template source by combining the preamble, template, and postamble and returns a two-tuple of the form: [source, offset], where source is the string containing (Ruby) source code for the template and offset is the integer line offset where line reporting should begin."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Template subclasses may override this method when they need complete control over source generation or want to adjust the default line offset. In most cases, overriding the #precompiled_template method is easier and more appropriate."
