- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Tells RSpec to extend example groups with `mod`. Methods defined in `mod` are exposed to example groups (not examples). Use `filters` to constrain the groups to extend.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Similar to `include`, but behavior is added to example groups, which are classes, rather than the examples, which are instances of those classes.
